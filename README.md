## Overview:
The Amazon Vine program uses Vine Voices to provide customers unbiased reviews of Amazon products.  Vine Voices are customers that are invited to join the program based on their reviewer rank.  The Vine members receive free products from Amazon that are provided by participating vendors, but vendors cannot influence, modify or edit the reviews.  More about Amazon Vine is available at https://www.amazon.com/gp/vine/help.

Amazon's review datasets (https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt) are organized by product category. The "Watches" dataset was selected for this analysis that proposes to determine if Amazon Vine members provide more favorable reviews than non-Vine members.

## Results:
Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary:

Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
